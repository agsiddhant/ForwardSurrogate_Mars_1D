# ForwardSurrogate_Mars_1D
1D Forward Surrogate of Mars

This jupyter notebook loads a trained Neural Network and uses it to predict the thermal evolution of Mars over 4.5 billion years. The user needs to enter the reference viscosity, activation energy, activation volume, crustal enrichment factor and initial temperature. 

This notebook is based on python3 and uses numpy, pickle, matplotlib and tensorflow (version 1.14.0).
